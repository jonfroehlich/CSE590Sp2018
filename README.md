# CSE590Sp2018: Ubiquitous Computing
The github repo for the Spring 2018 offering of [CSE590: Ubiquitous Computing](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1199409).

The aim of this class will be to introduce you to ubiquitous computing. We will focus on how traditional topics of computing have evolved to support the vision of a connected, portable, and a human-centric computing environment. The course will include discussion into contribution of various fields, including human-computer interaction, embedded computing, computer vision, distributed systems, machine learning, and electrical engineering. The students will gain practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as activity recognition, health sensing, gestural interaction, etc.

The course will be a combination of lectures, tutorials, class discussions, and demonstrations.

This course has been informed by Professor Shwetak Patel's [Spring 2015 offering](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/classes/cse590p/?Schedule) and Professor Mayank Goel's [Fall 2015 offering](http://www.mayankgoel.courses/teaching/ee590p-fall-2015/).

## Lectures
The class is broken into roughly five modules:
* L01: Introduction to ubicomp and Android
* L02-L04: Signal processing and machine learning in ubicomp systems
* L05-L06: Physical computing (Arduino, circuits, sensors, actuators)
* L07-L08: Computer vision in ubicomp systems
* L09-L10: Fabrication

You can view the lectures [here](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE590Sp2018/tree/master/LectureSlides).

## Course Materials
You must have a laptop for use in and out of class capable of running Android Studio and an Android emulator. We will be providing you with an Android device (a Huawei Honor7 running Android OS 7 aka Nougat), an Arduino board, and an electronics kit. All materials must be returned on the final day of class (June 7).

We will not be using a textbook; however, if you're interested, please see John Krumm's *Ubiquitous Computing Fundamentals*.

## Assignments
There are three categories of assignments in this course (see the Course Summary below for more details on assignment topics and due dates):

- [110 pts] Making: [five implementation assignments](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE590Sp2018/tree/master/Assignments) that enable you to learn and apply core methods, techniques, and approaches in ubiquitous computing (20 pts each + 2 pts for a midpoint check-in). These assignments are due every two weeks. The assignments can be [viewed here](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE590Sp2018/tree/master/Assignments)
- [18 pts] Paper reading + online discussion: each week, we will have one required reading + online discussion (2 pts). For a bonus, you can sign-up to lead an in-class discussion. See: https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1199409/discussion_topics/4253123.
- [~15 pts] Participation grade: participating in in-class and online discussions (*e.g.,* responding to a post), asking questions in class or on Canvas, and miscellaneous housekeeping assignments (*e.g.,* completing MakerSpace orientation, filling out background survey).
