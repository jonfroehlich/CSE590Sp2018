In this course, we have five assignments--one due every two weeks.

##[A1-StepTracker](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE590Sp2018/tree/master/Assignments/A01-StepTracker)
In this assignment, you will build your own step tracker using your Android smartphone's built-in accelerometer (and gyro, optional) along with basic signal processing algorithms and heuristics. You should not use machine learning for this assignment (e.g., supervised learning) as we will experiment with this approach in future assignments.
